# Godot Playground

## Introduction

This is a repository to hold my code for learning the Godot game engine, mainly from following along GameDev.tv's [Godot intro course](https://www.udemy.com/course/godot/).

## Using this repository

You'll need the Godot engine installed on your system. If you use Steam, you can get Godot from that, but you can also [download it from the Godot site](https://godotengine.org/download/windows). This repo currently uses the GDScript variant, not the Mono variant.
